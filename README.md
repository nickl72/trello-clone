Not Trello

Main Goals:
1. Users can add tasks to one of three categories: To Do, In Progress, Completed
1. Users can move tasks from category to category
1. To Do, In Progress, and Completed tasks have different styling to help differentiate them from one another
1. A user must be 'logged in' in order to add / move tasks, but a user can see the tasks whether logged in or not
1. Project must be broken into separate components (separate those concerns!) that each do one thing and one thing well


Stretch Goals:
1. Incorporate a React library to allow for dragging of tasks from category to category (strongly recommend https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable but there are a few out there)
1. Depending on which user logs in, persist tasks in state (this will clear on page refresh, but you can mock a database at least while the page doesn't refresh) so that if a user logs out and another user logs in the tasks will be different
1. Create different levels of user, an admin can create tasks whereas a normal logged in user can only move tasks, etc, etc
1. Pump up the styling! Add hover effects, make it look classy and professional
Successful homework completion includes all main goals, and at least one stretch goal.


This is definitely a work in progress so please let me (casey) know if this starts becoming way too much work. I want you all challenged but not falling asleep at 2am challenged.
